Game idea:
1. I think a 2D game would be for the best so we can easily open up whatever game engine and work on it without having to worry about performance issues and stuff.
2. I'd pick Unity for the game engine because it is quite beginner friendly and very stable with have a lot of community support as apposed to Godot. I don't use Unity that much so I assume the whole team can learn together as we go on.
3. The best type of games are VFX driven games that have an addictive design, which is why simple games like Balatro or Vampire Survivors get played so much. On top of that, they're easy to make relatively and good choice for a project and a team.

Structure:
1. The entirety of the game should be inside the Github repo, size shouldn't matter as we shouldn't expect to exceed 2GBs of data. Every file should be located into an appropriate subfolder as to make everything easily accessible to the whole group. [KR7ZY/GameDevCS4043 (github.com)](https://github.com/KR7ZY/GameDevCS4043)
2. Everyone should personally log every bit of their contributions in some public form, (which you can keep private to yourself). The team's devlog history is located in the github subfolder called 'Devlogs'.
