Game idea:
1. I think a 2D game would be for the best so we can easily open up whatever game engine and work on it without having to worry about performance issues and stuff.
2. I'd pick Unity for the game engine because it is quite beginner friendly and very stable with having a lot of community support as apposed to Godot. I don't use Unity that much so I assume the whole team can learn together as we go on.
3. The best type of games are VFX driven games that have an addictive design, which is why simple games like Balatro or Vampire Survivors get played so much. On top of that, they're easy to make relatively and good choice for a project and a team.
4. The game should have some story aspect as making plot can be easily contributed and give rise to making stuff like art and music.
5. All the rest has yet to be decided, whether it is scary or cute, or both, if it's pixel art, if it's anime, 

Structure:
1. The entirety of the game should be inside the Github repo, size shouldn't matter as we shouldn't expect to exceed 2GBs of data. Every file should be located into an appropriate subfolder as to make everything easily accessible to the whole group. [KR7ZY/GameDevCS4043 (github.com)](https://github.com/KR7ZY/GameDevCS4043)
2. Everyone should personally log every bit of their contributions in some public form, (which you can keep private from the group). The team's devlog history is located in the github subfolder called 'Devlogs'.

Roles:
1. Robert: I'm good with helping all around and molding everything together, I especially love rigging, modelling, and programming effects.
