Alfie Deedigan, and Arick Talukder:

Create the structure for a main menu.
(All you need to do is draw up your concept)
The simplest kind of main menu would look like this
![[Pasted image 20250211155411.png]]
But more thought should be put into it.

A main menu can have:
1. Settings corner cog wheel
2. What's new button
3. Stats/Achievements button
4. Play button
5. New Game
6. Continue Game
7. Saves
Options menu can have:
1. Resolutions
2. (Graphic options)
3. (Audio options)
4. (Filter options, e.g., colorblind)

Anastasiia Popova:

Come up with the idea of what the player sees.
The first thing the player sees, this sets the impression of the game.
For most unity games, the first thing you see is the unity popup and then the main menu.

Ideas:
1. A quick skippable story and narration.
2. N-Games popup instead of the unity logo.

Alex Palframan:

Design the main menu and introduction audio.
(If there is going to be a skippable story cutscene at the very beginning.)
Sound effects for clicking and hovering over buttons.
Maybe find an appropriate AI voice to use in place of the narration.

Jobanpreet Singh:

Design a consistent aesthetic.
(Harder than it seems)
Mainly just User Interface Colors.
1. Make sure text can easily be seen.
2. Make sure the font is satisfying.
3. Make sure the emotions conveyed through the colors are, mostly mysterious and a bit upset. (For example, like 'Don't Starve')
